    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I was born in New Prague Minnesota.</li>
      <li>I currently live in Burnsville Minnesota.</li>
      <li>I currently deliver packages for Amazon for my income.</li>
      <li>I have water skipped a snowmobile across a pond about the size of a football field.  Then I got a little cocky and (without as much of a headstart) sunk the snowmobile on the 2nd attempt! :)  You can probably find the video on my facebook page.</li>
    </ul>
    <label for="audio1">Sometimes I play rain and thunderstorms in the background as a source of white noise.  I find it relaxing.</label>
